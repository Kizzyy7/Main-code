<h2>My top 3 Shows of all-time.</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b><h3>Breaking Bad-</h3></b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>
          This is my favourite show because of the jaw dropping writing and
          the<br />
          perfect character developent. This show is defenitly a must watch
          for<br />
          everyone

  <li>
    <b><h3>Better Call saul-</h3></b>
    <ul>
      <b>
        <li>
          Similar to Breaking bad This show does not miss on any of the good<br />
          elements that make a great show. As its in the same universe as<br />
          breaking bad better call saul makes numerous references to breaking<br />
          bad.

  <li>
    <b><h3>9-1-1</h3></b>
    <ul>
      <b>
        <li>
          Taking a break from the breaking bad universe this show takes place
          in<br />
          our own universe. This show revolves around some well writen
          characers<br />
          that are all some type of law enforcment. They usually respond the
          the<br />
          crayziest emergancies in the L.A. region.<br />
